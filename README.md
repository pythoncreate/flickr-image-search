<h1>Flickr Image Gallery</h1>

<h2>This is Project 9 of the Treehouse Javascript Tech Degree Program</h2>

In this project I have built an image gallery using React and the Flickr API. 

I used create-react-app to get the project started, and used the axios tool to fetch the data from Flickr.

In order to start the project please use <b>NPM INSTALL</b> do install all dependent files. 

Type <b>NPM START</b> in the cmd line to run the application.
